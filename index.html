                Green is among the Republican legislators who, by calling for entire
                states to be disenfranchised in the 2020 presidential election,
                fomented the terrorist attack on the Capitol on January 6, 2021 that
                aimed to prevent the determination of the next president of the United
                States. Shortly after the 2020 election, Green joined a case before
                the Supreme Court calling for all the votes for president in Georgia,
                Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin — states that were narrowly won
                by Democrats — to be discounted, claiming that some voters there
                followed procedures set by the wrong state officials. The case
                amplified lies and conspiracy theories that fueled the movement that
                led to the attack on the Capitol. The Supreme Court rejected the case.
                Following the rejection of several cases before the Supreme Court, one
                legislator called for violence. On January 6, 2021 in the hours after
                the attack on the Capitol, Green voted for the exclusion of Arizona
                and/or Pennsylvania — states narrowly won by Democrats — from the
                count of Electoral College votes that determined the next President of
                the United States.
